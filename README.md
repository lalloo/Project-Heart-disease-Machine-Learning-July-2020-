# Project-Heart-disease-Machine-Learning-
Predicting Heart Disease using Machine Learning. In this case the problem we will be exploring is binary classification. Applying  pandas, Matplotlib and NumPy for data anaylsis, and  Scikit-Learn for machine learning and modelling respectively.

In the following stages looking at :

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) -understanding and going through a dataset and finding out more about it.
Model training - create model and predict a target variable based on other variables.
Model evaluation - evaluating a models predictions using problem-specific evaluation metrics.
Model comparison - comparing several different models to find the best one.
Model fine-tuning - once we have found suitable model, how can we improve it?
Feature importance - since we're predicting the presence of heart disease, are there some things which are more important for prediction?
Cross-validation - if we do build a good model, can we be sure it will work on unseen data?
Reporting what we have found and concluded

We will cover this in the following stpes :

1. Problem Definition
2. Data and their attributes
3. Evaluation
4. Features
5.Modelling and improvements
6.conclusion
